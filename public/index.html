		<h3>zown home</h3>
		<p>Welcome!</p>
		<p>Zown is a team-based strategy game that is like capture the flag on steroids. Teams compete head to head in a quest to control the most territories (aka zowns) on a map. To capture a zown, the player must secure the code from the zown's black box and text it to the main frame. Players must collaborate, communicate and execute their strategy quickly if they expect to win. At the end of 30 minutes, the team with the most points wins.</p>
		<p>Zown is a game currently in development and will launch in July 2011. More details to come soon.</p>
